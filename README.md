# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Detection
Early Prediction for Chronic Kidney Disease Detection: A Progressive Approach to Health Management

**üìå Objective**

This project is a complete end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts whether a patient is likely to have Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on medical input features. The project combines data science, model training, evaluation, and web deployment using Flask.

**What I did**

  - Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing of CKD dataset
  - In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
  - Implementation and comparison of multiple ML models:
      - Logistic Regression
      - Decision Tree
      - Random Forest
      - Artificial Neural Network (ANN using Keras + TensorFlow)
  - Model evaluation using metrics such as:
      - Accuracy
      - Confusion Matrix
  - Selection and serialization of the best-performing model using pickle
  - Flask web application for real-time prediction
  - Modular, readable, and extensible code structure

**Model Training Pipeline**

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Label encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling where necessary
