# Chronic_Kidney_Disease_Detection
Early Prediction for Chronic Kidney Disease Detection: A Progressive Approach to Health Management

**📌 Overview**

This project focuses on the early detection, severity prediction, and progression monitoring of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning and routine medical test data. By analyzing key health attributes such as GFR, creatinine, hemoglobin, and albumin levels, the system enables timely diagnosis and better treatment planning.

**🔬 Scenarios Covered**
1. Early Detection through Routine Tests
  Detects CKD at an early stage from standard test results like creatinine and albumin.

2. Predicting Disease Severity and Survival
  Uses AI models to estimate severity and survival likelihood based on biomarkers.

3. Monitoring Disease Progression
  Tracks patient test data over time to identify worsening trends and alert physicians.


**🛠️ Technologies Used**
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning (Classification models)
